# Airport leaderboard minecraft
Just a simple leaderboard to indicate who donated to the airport project. Built with HTML, CSS and JS. New people can be added to the leaderboard by extending the populateList array with a new user object. User icons are fetched from the Mojang API and Mineatar API. Server status is fetched from mcsrvstat.
